#nb-text-classifier project by Ella Steen and Sharon Patta 

This notebook performs text classification of medical conversation transcription data with three Naive Bayes-based models. Given a region of the body that is experiencing symptoms, the final model will return which of five medical categories a symptom in that region best fits into.
